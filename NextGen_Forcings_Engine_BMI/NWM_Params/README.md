Currently, we haven't pushed over any files that are necessary for this directory.
This directory is just a dummy directory required for original NWM Forcings Engine
configuration file. We will work to build this as an option in future optimizations 
of the NextGen Forcings Engine based on the requirements for each NWM operational 
configuration encapsulating the NWM domains. For brief description however, this 
directory contains parameterization files that are used for bias calibration and 
downscaling technqiues specific to the Noah-OWP modular domain that mimics the
original WRF-Hydro domain in previous NWM versions. Therefore, we will eventually
push over the necessary files over to this directory for the NextGen Forcings Engine
BMI that can be utilized for certain NWM operational configuration scenarios related
to providing the best meteorological forcing estimates to NextGen formulations mimicing
the original WRF-Hydro domains.
