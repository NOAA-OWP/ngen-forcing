### time_step_seconds
This variable is preset at 3600 seconds, which just reflects the BMI interval in which we advertise meteorological forcings to the framework. As of now, this value will not change until both the framework and the forcing engine adjust regridding intervals
- Example- time_step_seconds: 3600

### initial_time
This variable will always be set to 0, which just tells the framework that we're starting at the reference date stated in the config.yml file here below, which is labeled as "RefcstBDateProc"
- Example-  initial_time: 0

### NWM_VERSION
This is just a configuruation option telling the Forcing Engine BMI what version of the NWM this is forcing. This variable can be used for netcdf metadata output as a reference to the user
- Example- NWM_VERSION: 4.0 

### NWM_CONFIG
This variable just refers to a string of the Forcing Engine BMI configuration the user is implementing here. This variable can be used for netcdf metadata output as a reference to the user
- Example- NWM_CONFIG: "NWMv4_Medium_Range"

### InputForcings 
Choose a set of value(s) of forcing variables to be processed for WRF-Hydro. Please be advised that the order of which the values are chosen below are the order that the final products will be layered into the final LDASIN files. See documentation for additional information and examples. The following is a global set of key values to map forcing files to variables within LDASIN files for WRF-Hydro. The forcing engine will map files to external variable names internally. For custom external native forcing files (see documenation), the code will expect a set of named variables to process. The following is a mapping of numeric values to external input native forcing files:

### InputMandatory
Specify whether the input forcings listed above are mandatory, or optional. This is important for layering contingencies if a product is missing, but forcing files are still desired. 0 - Not mandatory, 1 - Mandatory. NOTE!!! If no files are found for any products, code will error out indicating the final field is all missing values.
- Example- InputMandatory: [1,1]

### OutputFrequency
Specify the output frequency in minutes. Note that any frequencies at higher intervals than what if provided as input will entail input forcing data being temporally interpolated.
- Example- OutputFrequency: 60

### SubOutputHour
New variable currently for NWMv3.1 operations to properly ingest GFS 13km forecast data that outputs various frequencies throughout the forecast cycle lifetime. This variable will properly account for reading time slices of the forecast cycle. Currently only needed for GFS 13km operational configuration. Otherwise, set this value to 0.
- Example- SubOutputHour: 0

### SubOutputFreq
New variable currently for NWMv3.1 operations to properly ingest GFS 13km forecast data that outputs various frequencies throughout the forecast cycle lifetime. This variable will properly account for reading time slices of the forecast cycle based on frequency of occurence. Currently only needed for GFS 13km operational configuration. Otherwise, set this value to 0.
- Example- SubOutputFreq: 0  

### ScratchDir
Specify a scratch directory that will be used for storage of temporary files. These files will be removed automatically by the program. at the end of the BMI instance. However, this directory will also store the output forcing file if requested by the user as well (will not be deleted in this instance).
- Example- ScratchDir: "./ScratchDir"

### Output
Specify whether or not you would like to request a single netcdf output file containg all of the regridded meteorological forcing fields for the domain configuration you set up within the config.yml file. Output: 0=No, 1=Yes
- Example- Output: 1

### compressOutput

### floatOutput
Flag to use floating point output vs scale_factor / add_offset byte packing in the output files (the default). 0 - Use scale/offset encoding, 1 - Use floating-point encoding. Only applicable in this instance when you request a netcdf output forcing file (Output: 1). Otherwise, just set to 0.
- Example- floatOutput: 0

### LookBack
Specify a lookback period in minutes to process data. This is required if you are processing a restrospective dataset or an AnA operational configuration. This value should specify how far back you need to look in time from your "RefcstBDateProc" start date that you specified. In this instance, that start date will be your actual end date. If no LookBack specified, please specify -9999.
- Example- LookBack: 180

### RefcstBDateProc
If running an operational configuration in realtime, this will be the defined start date for the NextGen Forcing Engine BMI which is assumed to be the beginning of the forecast cycle (i.e. hour 0). From there the first time step will be hour 1 from the start date specified here. If you're running an AnA or a retrospective dataset however, this variable becomes the end date of the simulation and the "LookBack" value specified above will be how far back you look in time for the AnA or retrospective dataset.
- Example- RefcstBDateProc: 202210071400

### ForecastFrequency
Specify a forecast frequency in minutes. This value specifies how often to generate a set of forecast forcings. If generating hourly retrospective forcings, specify this value to be 60.
- Example- ForecastFrequency: 60

### ForecastShift
Forecast cycles are determined by splitting up a day by equal ForecastFrequency interval. If there is a desire to shift the cycles to a different time step, ForecastShift will shift forecast cycles ahead by a determined set of minutes. For example, ForecastFrequency of 6 hours will produce forecasts cycles at 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC. However, a ForecastShift of 1 hour will produce forecast cycles at 01, 07, 13, and 18 UTC. NOTE - This is only used by the realtime instance to calculate forecast cycles accordingly. Re-forecasts will use the beginning and ending dates specified in conjunction with the forecast frequency to determine forecast cycle dates.
- Example- ForecastShift: 0

### ForecastInputHorizons
Specify how much (in minutes) of each input forcing is desires for each forecast cycle. See documentation for examples. The length of this array must match the input forcing choices.
- Example- ForecastInputHorizons: [60, 60]

### ForecastInputOffsets
This option is for applying an offset to input forcings to use a different forecasted interval. For example, a user may wish to use 4-5 hour forecasted fields from an NWP grid from one of their input forcings. In that instance the offset would be 4 hours, but 0 for other remaining forcings.
- Example- ForecastInputOffsets: [0, 0]
