Development of the NextGen Forcings Engine has been centered around the foundational pieces of the WRF-Hydro Forcings Engine developed by NCAR. The NOAA Office of Water Prediction (OWP) has take the original WRF-Hydro Forcings Engine used for the National Water Model (NWM) and extended it's data processing pipeline to accommodate the following capabilities for the original WRF-Hydro Forcings Engine: (1) Redevelop it's driver script into a compliant Basic Model Interface framework, (2) extend it's original regridding tools to streamline universal regridding capabilities to any domain configuration (e.g. gridded, mesh) besides the original WRF-Hydro domain it was intended for, (3) extend more regridding modules for different meteorological forcing datasets to supply the scientific community with a vast array of forecast or hindcast models that the Forcings Engine can supply to any hydrology domain configuration. NCAR's WRF-Hydro Forcing Engine repository also had Python modules to extract a subset of NWM operational configuration forecast model datasets from the NOMADS operational server. Here, we've also taken their initial subset of Python module NOMADS forcing extraction scripts and extended more Python modules to encompass all NWM v3.0 operational configurations currently being utilized by OWP. As NCAR continues to further develop the WRF-Hydro Forcings Engine and it's complimentary Python tools, we intend to continue expanding its features into the NextGen Forcings Engine BMI, while remaining compliant with it's own licensing as highlighted further below:
